Case studies and software applications for the PyPES journal paper

## Optimal Sensor Placement
In this case study, we implemented the algorithm from the paper ["Optimal flow sensor placement on wastewater treatment plants"](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.watres.2016.05.068) by Villez et al. to demonstrate how PyPES can be used to implement graph-based algorithms in a facility-agnostic fashion. The wastewater model is derived from [Benchmark Simulation Model no. 2 (BSM2)](https://doi.org/10.2166/9781780401171), which was originally developed by Gernaey et al.

### Usage
```
python optimal_sensor_placement.py [arguments]
```
#### Arguments
- `--mode` or `-m`: Specifies which Waste Water Treatment Plant (WWTP) to use. It accepts an integer value (1, 2, or 3) and defaults to 1 if not provided.
- `--update` or `-u`: A flag that, when set, enables update mode.
- `--log_file` or `-l`: Specifies the path to the log file where the results will be saved.
- `--original_log_file` or `-o`: Specifies the path to the original log file for comparison purposes in update mode.:

### Example
To run the script with the default WWTP (1) and save results to `results.txt`:
```bash
python optimal_sensor_placement.py --log_file results.txt
```
To run the script with WWTP 1 with update mode enabled and save results to `results_update.txt`:
```bash
python optimal_sensor_placement.py --mode 1 --update --log_file results_update.txt --original_log_file results.txt
```

## Fault Detection
In this case study, we implemented the algorithm from the paper ["Advanced monitoring of water systems using in situ measurement stations: data validation and fault detection"](https://doi.org/10.2166/wst.2013.302) by Alferes et al. to demonstrate how PyPES can ease the implementation of complex fault detection algorithms by managing data and metadata. The reverse osmosis treatment train comes from a real world desalination plant.

### Usage
```
python fault_detection.py [arguments]
```

#### Arguments
- `--tag_file` or `-t`: Specifies the path to the tag file with information about the sensors data.
- `--data_folder` or `-d`: Specifies the path to the data folder. Inside this folder, there should be one or more CSV files containing the data to be analyzed.
- `--train_test_split` or `-s`: Specifies the train-test split ratio. Default is 0.8.
- `--data_plot` or `-p`: Specifies the path to save the data plot. Default is `results/fault_detection/data.png`.
- `--json_path` or `-j`: Specifies the path to the network JSON file. Default is `json/desalination.json`.
- `--T2Q_plot` or `-t`: Specifies the path to save the T2Q plot. Default is `results/fault_detection/T2Q_plot.png`.
- `--PC_plot` or `-c`: Specifies the path to save the PC plot. Default is `results/fault_detection/PC_plot.png`.
### Example
To run the script with the default parameters:
```bash
python fault_detection.py
```
To run the script with a custom tag file and data folder:
```bash
python fault_detection.py --tag_file custom_tag.csv --data_folder custom_data
```

## Leakage Detection
In this case study, we implemented the algorithm from the paper ["Leakage fault detection in district metered areas of water distribution systems "](https://doi.org/10.2166/hydro.2012.109) by Eliades & Polycarpou to demonstrate how a user can automatically convert EPANet files into a PyPES model and then conduct analysis on a large number of nodes and connections. 

The distribution system model comes from [Dataset of BattLeDIM: Battle of the Leakage Detection and Isolation Methods](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4017658). The original distribution network, `L-TOWN.inp` and the converted PyPES model (`distribution.json`) are included in the `json` folder under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode) license, including the [Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/legalcode#s5). The citation, including full list of authors, can be found in [References](#references).

### Usage
To convert an EPANet file:
```
python epyt_utils.py json/L-TOWN.inp json/distribution.json
```

To run the leakage detection algorithm:
```
python leakage_detection.py
```
